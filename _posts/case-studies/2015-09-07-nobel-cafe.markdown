Nobel Cafe are an awarding winning Ballymena based cafe/restaurant that I have worked with on numerous occasions over the past number of years.  The majority of work that I took on for Nobel was print based (menu design, posters etc).

In December 2014 I was approached about taking on the task of redesigning and developing their website.  At the time, it was a very dated design and they also had no way of updating the content on the site.

## The Brief

The Nobel Cafe premises underwent a face lift in October 2014, so they felt this would be a good time to get the ball rolling on a new website.  In terms of a brief as such, everything was left entirely to me use my professional judgement, so long as the following were accounted for:

- Modern design to reflect the new premises
- Online Menus
- Ability for customers to submit reviews
- Display reviews
- CMS integration

Receiving a brief like this was only possible because I know people at Nobel Cafe with working with them previously - normally I would expect a more detailed breakdown with what is required in a project.

## The Solution

My main goals when starting this website was to come up with a modern design and to make it a really fast site.  When trying to think of scenario’s as to why users would be on a cafe’s website, I kept coming back to the same one.  To check the menu.    

Straight away it was in my head that the menu I create for Nobel Cafe, has to be rendered with HTML & CSS - unlike many cafe’s &amp; restaurant’s which choose to upload a PDF - which the user then has to download before they can read it. Nightmare.

Out of the box, creating the menu in HTML & CSS would also help with pagespeed as PDFs can tend to be quite large in size if they’re not optimised properly.

Above, you can see the solution I came up with for the menus.  With their being more than one menu, I opted for a Javascript show and hide so that it is only taking up a small section of the website - if all the menus where on show it would add too much scrolling for the user.  It may also become overwhelming for  them too and they may not get the information they were looking as menus tend to quite text heavy.
