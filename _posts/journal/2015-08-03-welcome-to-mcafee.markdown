You either die a hero or you live long enough to see yourself become the villain.  Accomplice? I'm gonna tell them the whole thing was your idea. There you are! There is nothing to fear but fear itseIf!

Batman may have made the front page but Bruce Wayne got pushed to page eight.

The training is nothing! Will is everything! The will to act.

Pretty soon we will be chasing down over due library books.

If you can tell me the Russian for "apply your own bloody suntan lotion."

When their enemies were at the gates the Romans would suspend democracy and appoint one man to protect the city. It wasn't considered an honor, it was a public service.

If you're good at something, never do it for free.

You should use your full name. I like that name, Robin.

I will go back to Gotham and I will fight men Iike this but I will not become an executioner.

Ooh, you think darkness is your ally? You merely adopted the dark, I was born in it. Molded by it. I didn't see the light until I was already a man. By then there was nothing to be but blinded.

Every man who has lotted here over the centuries, has looked up to the light and imagined climbing to freedom. So easy, so simple! And like shipwrecked men turning to seawater foregoing uncontrollable thirst, many have died trying. And then here there can be no true despair without hope. So as I terrorize Gotham, I will feed its people hope to poison their souls. I will let them believe that they can survive so that you can watch them climbing over each other to stay in the sun. You can watch me torture an entire city. And then when you've truly understood the depth of your failure, we will fulfill Ra's Al Ghul's destiny. We will destroy Gotham. And then, when that is done, and Gotham is... ashes Then you have my permission to die.

Your Punishment Must Be More Severe.
