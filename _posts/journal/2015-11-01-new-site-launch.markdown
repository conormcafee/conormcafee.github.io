It’s been a busy 2 years since I graduated university and have come a long way in my career since then.  I’m now at the stage where I want to give more back to the web design community - and feel that I am better equipped to do that now.

The thinking behind this website is that I am going to:

- Blog more on Front-End Development
- Experiment more (Labs section coming soon)
- Provide in-depth Case Studies

## Blogging

Like the majority of people in the same line of work as me, you learn mainly from reading blog posts and tutorials people have put online.  I would like to be a part of that now.  I will be blogging about my experiences with:

- [Gulp.js]
- [Sass]
- [BEM]
- [Github]

I’m not proclaiming to be an expert at any of these, not by a long shot - but I do want to document more about how i’ve learned to get to grips with these tools and incorporate them into my workflow.  Hopefully it can help someone else.

## Case Studies

Along with blogging and experiments, it is important for any designer &amp; front-end developer to document work that they have done for other people.  There are only certain projects which I can talk about on a public forum, alot of the work I have completed has been done whilst employed by a company - and therefore is the companies work rather than mine.

I look forward to sharing more with you all soon.
