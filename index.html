      <p>
        I'm a <b>Senior UX Engineer</b> from Ireland, currently working on
        interesting and challenging solutions for
        <a href="https://white.space/" target="_blank" title="Whitespace"
          >Whitespace</a
        >
        out of their Belfast office.
      </p>

      <p>
        Working primarly with
        <a href="https://reactjs.org/" target="_blank">React</a> &
        <a href="https://www.gatsbyjs.org/" target="_blank">Gatsby JS</a>, but
        prone to
        <a href="https://craftcms.com/" target="_blank">Craft CMS</a> project
        from time to time.

      <blockquote>
        <h2>What is a UX Engineer?</h2>

        <p>
          A UX Engineer (UXE) is a Front-End Engineer who sits on a
          cross-functional design team and helps facilitate collaboration
          between design and engineering.
        </p>

        <p>
          UXEs possess the skill-set of a Front-end Engineer but with working
          knowledge of UX design principles. Their primary domain focuses on the
          design/UI component layer of an application and steers away from the
          middleware layer between front-end and back-end development.

      <h2>Lately...</h2>

      <p>
        I have been involved in building a web platform for a London fintech
        company to help traders better understand their portfolio risk (amongst
        many other great features).
      </p>

      <p>
        Building the component library for an internal product which helps
        companies with their decision making with the help of smarts from
        machine learning.
      </p>

      <p>
        Taking a website and re-building from scratch, this time with more focus
        on the user experience to help travellers find trips suited to their
        preference and previous experiences. This project again had the help of
        machine learning to aid the user experince with smarter results.
      </p>

      <p>
        The difference in my role as a Senior UX Engineer than the description
        above, is that I get involved in the more complex data and middleware
        layers of a project also, which gives me a great deal of variety on a
        daily basis
