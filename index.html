      <p class="about__text">Focusing mainly on RWD (Responsive Website Design), I have developed a strong knowledge on building websites for not only desktops, but mobiles &amp; tablets too.</p>

      <p class="about__text">A key aspect which is often forgot about regarding RWD is the performance of the websites.  This is an area which I love working on and trying to make the websites as fast and performant as possible.</p>

      <p class="about__text">I have worked solely, or within a team on projects for:</p>
