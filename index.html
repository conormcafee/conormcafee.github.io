          I'm a <b>Senior UX Engineer</b> from Ireland, currently working on
          interesting and challenging solutions for
          <a href="https://white.space/" target="_blank" title="Whitespace"
            ><span>Whitespace</span></a
          >, based in their Belfast office.
        </p>

        <p>
          For the past 2.5 years I have been working primarly with
          <a href="https://reactjs.org/" target="_blank"><span>React</span></a>.
        </p>

        <p>
          As well as performing my tasks as a UX Engineer at Whitespace, I also get to be involved
          in the more complex data and middleware layers of projects.  Getting to do so, opens up all aspects of 
          the front-end to me on a daily business.
        </p>

        <h2 class="heading">Recent work involves:</h2>

        <p>
          Building a component library to support a fully dynamic front-end,
          which is driven by data on the back-end.
        </p>

        <p>
          Building a web platform for a London fintech company to help traders
          better understand their portfolio risk.
        </p>

        <p>
          Building a component library for an internal product which helps
          companies make better financial decisions, aided by some smarts from
          machine learning.

          <h1 class="heading">What is a UX Engineer?</h1>

          <p>
            A UX Engineer (UXE) is a Front-End Engineer who sits on a
            cross-functional design team and helps facilitate collaboration
            between design and engineering.
          </p>

          <p>
            UXEs possess the skill-set of a Front-end Engineer but with working
            knowledge of UX design principles. Their primary domain focuses on
            the design/UI component layer of an application and steers away from
            the middleware layer between front-end and back-end development.
